Rretrieving and process email data from the Sakai open source project. Creating databases and cleaning up, and modeling the data.

This is a large amount of data and requires significant cleanup to make sense of the data before we visualize it.
Subset of the data and run the steps to process the data.

Here is the software we will be using to retrieve and process the email data:

If you have a fast network connection with no bandwidth charge - you can download all the data. If you try to download all the data it may take well over 24 hours to pull the data. The good news is that because there are separate crawl, clean, model, and visualization steps, you can start and stop the crawl process as often as you like and run the other processes on the data that has been downloaded so far.
